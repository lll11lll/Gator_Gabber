# SPN1130 Course Materials

Place your SPN1130 PDF files here:
- Vocabulary PDFs
- Grammar PDFs  
- Practice exercises
- Course notes
- Any other relevant Spanish learning materials

After adding PDFs, run from the server directory:
```bash
python build_rag_index.py
```

This will process your PDFs and create a searchable knowledge base for Alberto to reference when helping SPN1130 students.
